```
# grab the request with burp suite which contain your credit card number and replace them with FUZZ_CC 
# replace month with FUZZ_MN
# replace year with FUZZ_YR
# replace cvv with FUZZ_CVV
# DNT: 1 add this in the end of your header
# and your can run this command 
# ./chxd creditC proxy.txt cc.txt config.txt
